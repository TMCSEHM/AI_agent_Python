Extending the Project
You've completed the required steps, but have some fun with it! (Carefully, though... be very cautious about giving an LLM access to your filesystem and Python interpreter.) See if you can get it to:

Fix harder and more complex bugs
Refactor sections of code
Add entirely new features
You can also try:

Other LLM providers
Other Gemini models
Giving it more functions to call
Other codebases (commit your changes before running the agent on a codebase, so you can always revert)
